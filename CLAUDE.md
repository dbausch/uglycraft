# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Building and publishing distributables

Tasks are managed with **poethepoet** (`pyproject.toml`). `poe` is installed globally via pipx.

| Task | Action |
|---|---|
| `poe install` | Create venv and install all dependencies |
| `poe run` | Run the game (e.g. `poe run --level 5`) |
| `poe build-linux` | Build `dist/linux-64/uglycraft` + license notices (~41 MB) |
| `poe setup-windows` | One-time: install Python 3.13 + deps into Wine |
| `poe build-windows` | Build `dist/windows-64/uglycraft.exe` + license notices (~25 MB) via Wine |
| `poe build-original` | Fetch UOS source (curl) and build `original/UGLI_2` with FPC |
| `poe clean` | Remove all build artifacts (`dist/`, `build/`, compiled Pascal output) |
| `poe deploy` | Push all four itch.io channels with current git tag as version |
| `poe deploy-uglycraft` | Push Linux and Windows channels only |
| `poe deploy-original-linux` | Push `dist/original-linux` to itch.io |
| `poe deploy-original-dos` | Push `dist/original-dos` to itch.io |
| `poe deploy-aur` | Copy PKGBUILD + .SRCINFO to `../uglycraft-aur`, commit and push |

Build and deploy are separate steps — deploy tasks only call butler, never build.
Windows build requires Wine installed via the system package manager; `poe setup-windows` handles the rest.
Version is read from the latest git tag automatically.

## Development workflow

Every non-trivial change follows this sequence. Skipping a step requires an
explicit justification in the commit message.

### 1 — Plan

Clarify scope and approach before touching any file. For architectural
decisions use plan mode; for smaller changes a short conversation is enough.
The plan's output is a committed spec file — not uncommitted notes.

### 2 — Spec

Write a spec file (`original/spec/<topic>.md` for Pascal work; an inline
comment block for Python work where a separate file would be disproportionate).
Every spec must contain:
- A **status checklist** at the top — one line per deliverable, using GFM
  syntax: `- [ ]` (not yet done) / `- [x]` (confirmed working).
- A **"Done when:"** section at the bottom listing the acceptance criteria.

Commit the spec alone, before any implementation code.

**After committing the spec, stop and wait for the user to confirm it before
proceeding to tests or implementation.** Never move from step 2 to step 3
without an explicit confirmation message. The user may want to adjust scope,
wording, or approach before any code is written.

### 3 — Tests (`original/` Pascal work only)

Add tests to `UGLI_2_Test.pp` that cover the required behaviour.
Run `poe test-original` and confirm the new tests are **red**.
Implement until the suite is **green** (`poe test-original` exits 0).
A task is not complete while a test it introduced is still failing.

For Python/UGLYCRAFT work there is no automated suite; describe the manual
verification steps in the spec instead.

### 4 — Implement

Write the code. Keep commits on topic — one logical concern per commit
(see global CLAUDE.md commit-discipline rules).

### 5 — Gates (Pascal / `original/` work)

Both must pass before the work is called done:

```
poe build-original   # zero compiler errors
poe test-original    # all tests pass, exit 0
```

Spec items labelled "manual check" or "user acceptance" may only be marked ✓
after the user has **explicitly stated in a message** that the behaviour works
correctly. An exit code of 0 or a process completing without error is not
confirmation. Never infer acceptance from tooling output alone.

### 6 — Maintain living documents

After every substantive commit to `original/`:

| Document | What to update |
|---|---|
| `original/CHANGELOG.md` | Add entries to `[Unreleased]`; merge into existing category headings |
| `original/CLAUDE.md` | Update if data structures, procedures, file layout, or `uses` clause changed |
| Spec checklist | Mark items `- [x]` only after the user confirms the behaviour works |

After a release (new git tag + `poe deploy`):

| Document | What to update |
|---|---|
| `CLAUDE.md` (this file) | Bump **Current version** |
| `original/CHANGELOG.md` | Close `[Unreleased]` into a versioned section |

## Licensing

UGLYCRAFT is GPLv3. Distributables also bundle pygame (LGPL 2.1) and numpy (BSD 3-Clause).
License texts live in `LICENSES/` and are copied into each build by the poe tasks.
`LICENSES/NOTICE.txt` summarises what is bundled and under what terms.

## Current version

**v1.4** — bump this whenever a new git tag is created.

## What this is

This repo contains two things:

1. **The original game** — UGLI (version 2, 1996), a DOS text-mode game written in Turbo Pascal 7 by Daniel Bausch. Source files: `UGLI_2.pp`, plus `UOSSound.pp` (FPC/Linux sound via UOS + PortAudio). See [`original/CLAUDE.md`](original/CLAUDE.md) for a full analysis of the original code, data structures, and mechanics.

2. **UGLYCRAFT** — a new Python/pygame spiritual remake of UGLI, written from scratch. This is the active project.

## Knowledge base

`kb/` contains reference files loaded on demand — not always in context.
Use them when working on a topic that needs deeper background.

| File | Contents |
|---|---|
| `kb/uglycraft-mechanics.md` | Scoring, lives, shield, speed formula, state machine, boss behaviour |
| `kb/uglycraft-levels.md` | Wall layouts and enemy start positions for all 10 levels |
| `kb/uglycraft-display.md` | Integer scaling, HUD layout, sprite construction notes |
| `kb/uglycraft-sound.md` | Sound generation, music keys, trigger map, fallback behaviour |
| `kb/findings.md` | Bugs, quirks, and key differences between Pascal original and Python remake |

`original/kb/` covers the Pascal source — see `original/CLAUDE.md`.

## System prerequisites

| Tool | Required for |
|---|---|
| `fpc` (Free Pascal) | `poe build-original`, `poe test-original` |
| `curl` | `poe build-original` (fetches UOS source + `ANSI-87.conf` on first run) |
| `libportaudio.so.2` | `poe run-original` (runtime sound; fails silently if absent) |
| `wine` | `poe setup-windows`, `poe build-windows` |
| `butler` (itch.io) | all `poe deploy*` tasks |

## Running UGLYCRAFT

```bash
pipx install poethepoet   # one-time; virtualenv via package manager
poe install               # creates .venv and installs pygame, numpy, pyinstaller
poe run
```

Or directly: `.venv/bin/python main.py --level N --easy/--hard`

In debug mode (`--level`) the high-score entry screen is suppressed.

## Architecture (8 Python files)

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `constants.py` | Logical resolution, tile size, colours, timing constants |
| `sprites.py` | All sprites drawn procedurally via `pygame.draw` — no image files |
| `levels.py` | 10 level definitions as dicts with `walls` and `enemy_starts` |
| `entities.py` | `Player` and `Enemy` (+ `Entity` base) — tile-grid movement, BFS pathfinding |
| `hiscore.py` | Top-10 score persistence to `uglycraft.hsc` |
| `sounds.py` | `SoundManager` — 14 procedural SFX + 12 music tracks (10 levels, title, win) |
| `game.py` | Full state machine + rendering. Note: a `STORY` state exists in code but is not reachable from the UI. |
| `main.py` | Window creation, integer scaling, top-level event loop |
